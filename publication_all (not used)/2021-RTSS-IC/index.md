abstract: "We regard the industry challenge as a multiobjective real-time scheduling problem. Different from traditional methods, we model it as a nonlinear program (NLP) and use gradient-based methods for efficient solutions. Different requirements can be freely added as constraints, which gives the proposed method effective for a large range of problems. Furthermore, the proposed NLP scheduling method can utilize available scheduling algorithm as initialization method, and improve their performance even further. Preliminary evaluation shows advantages against simple heuristic methods in complicated problems."
