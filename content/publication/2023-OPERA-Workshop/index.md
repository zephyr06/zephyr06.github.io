abstract: "When optimizing real-time systems, designers often face a challenging problem where the schedulability constraints are non-convex, non-continuous, or lack an analytical form to understand their properties. Although the optimization framework NORTH proposed in previous work is general (it works with arbitrary schedulability analysis) and scalable, it can only handle problems with continuous variables, which limits its application. In this paper, we extend the applications of the framework NORTH to problems with a hybrid of continuous and discrete variables. This is achieved in a coordinate-descent method, where the continuous and discrete variables are optimized separately during iterations. The new framework, NORTH+, improves around 20 solution quality than NORTH in experiments."
